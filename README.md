This repository is meant to be a template that can be used to encapsulate resources for computational courses.

Edit this readme file to add instructions for your students. The main instruction sets should include:

- fork this repository into your own github account
- open the github repository within VS Code

Along with the instructions for the student, you may want to include a requirements.txt file. This would only be necessary if you are not getting students to learn how to install modules as part of their assignments.
